	Abstract = {Frequently, the computation of derivatives for optimizing time-dependent
	ow problems is based on the integration of the adjoint dierential
	equation. For this purpose, the knowledge of the complete forward
	solution may be required. Similar information is needed in the context
	of a posteriori error estimation with respect to a given functional.
	In the area of fow control, especially for three dimensional problems,
	it is usually impossible to keep track of the full forward solution
	due to the lack of storage capacities. Further, for many problems,
	adaptive time-stepping procedures
	
	are needed toward ecient integration schemes in time. Therefore,
	standard optimal oine checkpointing strategies are usually not well-suited
	in that framework.
	
	
	In this paper we present two approaches for an online checkpointing
	procedure that determines the checkpoint distribution on the y. We
	will prove that these approaches determine checkpointing distributions
	that are either optimal or almost optimal with only a small gap to
	optimality. Numerical results underline the theoretical results.},
