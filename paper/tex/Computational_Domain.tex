\section{Computational Domain}

For this paper, the simulations are run on a family of five structured meshes ranging from extremely coarse to fine. These are stated in table ~\ref{tab:naca0012_mesh}. As described in the AIAA Turbulence Model Resources online, the meshes are all C-meshes with the farfield located at a distance of 500 chord lengths from the airfoil.  The mesh spacing near the boundary in the wall normal direction meets the $y+<=1$ condition.

Characteristic based farfield boundary conditions are applied to the outer boundary of the mesh and an adiabatic wall boundary condition is applied to the airfoil surface.
