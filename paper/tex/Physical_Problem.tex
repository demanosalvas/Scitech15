\section{Physical Problem}

Describe the physical problem that we are solving, the types of meshes that we are using and the physical conditions at which we are solving it. 
Describe how this problem is valuable for understanding the limits of the code and how this article will map the convergence of the code and the influence of the limiters and the CFL to minimize the number of iterations.
