\subsection*{Convergence Optimization}
Describe the process used to find the CFL number that will converge the solution in the minimum number of iterations, and how this is done for each of the limiters. Quick description on how the limiters work and how the limiter characteristic distance has been chosen and scaled to fit for all the mesh sizes\cite{Venkatakrishnan:1993}.
